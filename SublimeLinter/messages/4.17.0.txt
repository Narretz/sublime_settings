SublimeLinter 4.17.0

Mostly shipping maintenance, we have two notable changes for plugins:

- Beside the obvious `line` and `col` you can now capture `end_line` and
  `end_col` in the regexes.  The low level `LintMatch` usually used with JSON
  formats also understands these keys of course.

- If a plugin wants to log something, no need to `import logging; ...` anymore,
  as there is a configured `self.logger` now.

  As a reminder:

  * `self.logger.info("message")` only emits in debug mode
  * `self.logger.warning("message")` always emits to Sublime's builtin console
  * `self.logger.error("message")` popups a panel (usually don't!)
